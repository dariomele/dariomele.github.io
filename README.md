# Dario Mele – PhD Student in Physics

Welcome to my GitHub Pages! 🌌  
I’m a PhD student at University of Genoa, exploring quantum computation, quantum machine learning, and coding qubits.  

## About Me
I love experimenting with quantum algorithms and building software that makes qubits dance 🚀.  
Currently, I’m working on projects that involve:

- Quantum Gradient Calculators  
- Parameterized Quantum Circuits
- Variational Quantum Algorithms
- Quantum Kernel Learning models 

## Projects
- **Quantum Gradient Calculator** – [link]  
- **Another Project** – [link]
